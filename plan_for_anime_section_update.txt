Information Gathered:
- The anime section currently uses divs with class "card" containing a child div with class "card-front box" and a sibling div with class "buttons".
- The action section uses a similar structure but the "buttons" div contains anchor tags with hrefs pointing to video files, while the anime section mostly has "#" hrefs.
- The action section's "card-front box" divs have background images and h3 titles similar to the anime section.
- The main difference is in the structure and possibly the classes used for the swiper container and pagination.

Plan:
- Update the anime section's swiper container and pagination classes to match those of the action section.
- Ensure the "buttons" div structure in the anime section matches the action section's structure, including anchor tags and buttons.
- Preserve all anime items' names and pictures exactly as they are.
- Make sure the swiper-wrapper and swiper-slide classes are consistent with the action section.
- No changes to other sections or files.

- Confirm no changes to anime items' names or pictures.
